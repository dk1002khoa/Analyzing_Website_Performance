# Analyzing_Website_Performance
Analyze website performance, where customers are landing on the
website and how they make their way through the conversion
funnel
Tell the story of the company's growth, using the trend of the performance data. Use the database to explain, some of the details around your growth story, and quantify the revenue impact of some of your wins.  Analyze current performance, and use the data available to assess upcoming opportunities.
While we’re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type?  Flexing our analytical muscles a little and showing the board we really know our traffic sources. 
For the landing page test analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders.  Using the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 – Jul 28).
Quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 – Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand the monthly impact.
